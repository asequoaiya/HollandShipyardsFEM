This is essentially the numerical energy method as described in S. Zhang's 1999 PhD thesis "The Mechanics of Ship Collisions". 
The numerical energy method pertains to the collisions between two ships, which the thesis covers in pages 8-22.
This method is contained in the directory "EnergyEstimation".

This is a project done as part of a half-year tenure at Holland Shipyards.
